# Chatex
I worked on a simple chat app that lets users message each other. It includes a search feature to find users easily.
For the Chatex App, I used a variety of tools:
1. Provider for managing app state.
2. Firebase service for user logins and data storage.
3. Shared preferences for saving user settings and data.
4. Validator for checking user inputs
